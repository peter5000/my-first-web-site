            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document 
                written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). 
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
                This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation 
                characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces 
                complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve 
                the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
